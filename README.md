# Sales-forcasting-using-Sentiment-Analysis
This project describes how sentiment analysis places a vital role in the sales of a product. Depicting Consumer behavior and opinion aids firms to improve their customer satisfaction by using these machine learning techniques firms to tend to follow the strategies and opportunities in their products and services. Recent growth in retail industry attempts to improve the long established SFT techniques which has a gap when analyzing large data of consumer reviews efficiently, to determine the effectiveness of this approach models such as SVM, Linear Regression and KNN. Although there has been a procedure of using sentiment analysis for tracking the sales forecast by considering the customerâ€™s tastes, preferences and perception towards the product by using algorithms and AI methodologies, it is still in a very nascent stage as complete exploration have still not been adequately done. Also, the senior management does not get a complete insight of how these ratings derived by perceptions and expressions affect the sales forecast, these are still used to predict to a large extent, and this definitely helps in product improvements. Although several methods have been proposed to use product reviews for business intelligence like the KNN, SVM and Linear Regression, still great deal of work are kept in anvil. The aim of this study is to extract and derive patterns and develop them into business insights based on aspect-based sentiment analysis which can be utilized for product improvement recommendations for higher market penetration and effective pricing mechanism.
